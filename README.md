# SonanciaDataSet
Sound Files and their pairwise preferences

Sonancia Crowdsourcing DataSet

This DataSet includes the crowdsourcing annotations, which was used to train audio affect models for the Sonancia system. If you end up using this dataset within your work, please cite the following paper: Lopes, Liapis and Yannakakis, "Modelling Affect for Horror Soundscapes", IEEE Transactions of Affective Computing, 2017.


Preference Annotations

Preference annotations are organized in a .csv file where the name of each file refers what affect state was annotated and the dataset type. Affect states consist of: Arousal, Tension, Valence. The dataset set type consists of which sounds are included in that specific dataset. Each line consists of a preference annotation such as: [Preferred_Sound_Name],[Unpreferred_Sound_Name]
